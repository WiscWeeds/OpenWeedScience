      <description>Background Assessments of visual weed control in response to herbicide treatments is likely the most common experiment and data analysis conducted within the Weed Science discipline. The goal of these experiments is to investigate herbicides that promote the best level of control of targeted weed species. These experiments are usually organized in a one-way randomized complete block design with multiple treatments (herbicides). At a pre-established number of days after treatment (DAT; researcher choice), a percent (%) visual control rate is given to each targeted weed.</description>

      <description>Background Cropâ€“weed competition is extensively studied in weed science. The additive design, in which weed density varies and the crop density is kept constant, is the most commonly utilized design in plant competition studies. The additive design is important to calculate economic weed thresholds and improve weed control decision-making.

      <description>Symposia A RStudio symposia was conducted at the 74th North Central Weed Science Society (NCWSS) Meeting in Columbus, OH on December 11, 2019. Thanks to Ethann Barnes for putting together the RStudio symposia and NCWSS committee members for accepting our proposal.
Talks Title: Basics of R and RStudio. Presenter: Dr. Ethann R. Barnes, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Title: Data wrangling with dplyr. Presenter: Dr. Maxwel C. Oliveira, University of Wisconsin-Madison Title: An introduction to using R for weed population dynamics modeling.</description>
