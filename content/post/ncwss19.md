title: Using RStudio for Visualization and Analysis of Weed Science Experiments
---

A RStudio symposia was conducted at the 74th North Central Weed Science Society (NCWSS) Meeting in Columbus, OH on December 11, 2019. Thanks to [Ethann Barnes](https://twitter.com/EthannBarnes) for putting together the RStudio symposia and NCWSS committee members for accepting our proposal. 

The following topics were presented:

```yaml
Title: Basics of R and RStudio. 
Presenter: Dr. Ethann R. Barnes, University of Nebraska-Lincoln

Title: Data wrangling with dplyr. 
Presenter: Dr. Maxwel C. Oliveira, University of Wisconsin-Madison

Title: An introduction to using R for weed population dynamics modeling.
Presenter: Dr. Erin Burns, Michigan State University

Title: Using drc package for dose response and critical period analysis.
Presenter: Dr. Stevan Knezevic, University of Nebraska-Lincoln

Title: Using ggplot2 for plotting drc Models and dose response data.  
Presenter: Dr. Ethann R. Barnes, University of Nebraska-Lincoln

Title: Creating reproducible reports using R markdown.
Presenter: Dr. Maxwel C. Oliveira, University of Wisconsin-Madison

```

There were a mix of faculty, students and industry personnel attending the Rstudio symposia. The attendees were of different skill levels in R; thus, the workshop covered from the basics to the advanced levels. Three important topics of weed research were presented, including weed population modeling, critical time for weed control, and dose-response studies. In addition, it was demonstrated the power of RStudio to produce high quality documents and manuscripts for publications in scientific journals. The feedback was positive and we are looking forward to contribute with the NCWSS again.
